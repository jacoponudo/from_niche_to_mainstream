## README for "From Niche to Mainstream" Repository

### Overview
This repository contains the code and data used for the analysis and visualizations presented in the study "From Niche to Mainstream: Community Size and Engagement in Social Media Conversations". The research explores the interplay between platform design, community size, and user engagement across six social media platforms over a 33-year period.

### Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

1. src/
This directory contains all the scripts used for generating the plots and visualizations in the study. Each script corresponds to a specific figure or analysis section. The naming convention aligns with the section titles in the paper for easy navigation.

2. pro/
This directory includes preprocessing scripts. These scripts handle tasks such as:

### Data cleaning
Feature extraction
Formatting datasets for analysis
3. data/
Contains the raw and preprocessed datasets used in the study. Note: Sensitive or large datasets may not be included in the repository but can be requested if needed.
4. output/
Generated plots, visualizations, and any intermediate or final results are saved here.

### Key Features
Multi-platform Analysis: Scripts are provided to compare user engagement and re-entry behavior across platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Gab, Usenet, and Voat.
Size Effects: Analysis scripts explore the impact of community size and thread size on user behavior.
Custom Metrics: Implements metrics such as user participation density matrices and re-entry probability calculations.
